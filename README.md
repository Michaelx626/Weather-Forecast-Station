<h2 align="center"> Project Description </h2>
<p align="center"> This project will help users determine the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast. The weather will consist of temperature, wind, and humidity. There will be an emoji display representing the weather condition for those days. This application will only accept cities and states so any invalid string will return error 404; displaying a message to users to please try again. This project has helped me understand the importance of server APIs and what's their functionalities. We were able to fetch a response and data from the server APIs which will play an important role in future projects. </p>
